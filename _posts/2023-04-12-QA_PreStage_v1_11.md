[# Welcome to {{ post.title }}]: #

[Hopefully, this will be a brief overview of any changes in the version]: #

Issue reported at site where script did not allow itself to be run on multiple servers.
The Script user could not be verified as a Domain user.
This was due to missing the default AD container for Users

- Added further error handling for cases where User Context Type could not be determined
