[# Welcome to {{ post.title }}]: #

[Hopefully, this will be a brief overview of any changes in the version]: #

Even less excitement this time round, without further ado, lets begin.

- change to IP Information result to fail on ipv6 enabled and warn on dhcp enabled
Previously, this only reported a warning on DCHP settings if ipv6 was disabled

I hope you like it!
